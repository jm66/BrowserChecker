Enhancements by this release:
This building block – a Work-In-Progress- is a fork of Durham’s Blackboard Browser Tester b2 written by Malcolm Murray. What I’ve done besides of changing the basic look-and-feel, I customized some of the test elements such as third party components files, and the main layout.

The following tests were added:
- Connection Speed test (jQuery)
- Java Plugin test (Applet)
- Single SignOn test (Shibboleth / Blackboard’s new Auth Framework)
- Integration with a fork of BrowserCheck.js and plugins.js by Shannon Meisenheimer
- Integration with feedback.js project by Niklas von Hertzen (http://goo.gl/iAiy8)
