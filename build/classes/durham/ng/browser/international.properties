# Pop-ups
testBrowser.PopUp=Pop-ups
testBrowser.PopUp.text=Some web pages in Blackboard use JavaScript Pop-up message boxes and alerts to communicate information to you<br>\
Pop-up blocking software installed in your web browser (e.g. in the Yahoo and Google Toolbars) can prevent you from seeing these - \
unless it is configured to allow Pop-up from Blackboard<br> \
Use the buttons below to test whether your browser currently allows Pop-up and alert messages:

# Common Third Party File Types
testBrowser.CommonFiles=Common Third Party File Types
testBrowser.CommonFilesInstructions=Many course documents in Blackboard are in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Office format which require third party programs to be installed on your computer before you can open them. \
Some combinations of Windows/Office service packs and browser security settings have been known to cause access problems.</p> \
<p>To see if you are affected, try downloading these samples:

# ---------------------------------
# module/testPopup.jsp
testPopUp.Title=Pop-Up Test
testPopUp.Text=Pop-Up windows are pages that are often smaller than normal and which appear in \
front of your existing browser window. \
Sometimes security settings on your browser will prevent them from being displayed. <br><br>\
If this page appeared in a new window and is a different size then your browser is set to allow Pop-up windows from your Blackboard server :-)<br>\
If it looks like any other Blackboard page and didn't open in a new window, then one or more browser settings are preventing them from being displayed properly
testPopUp.Required.javascriptFail=Currently your browser is set to prevent JavaScript<br>\
This has forced this page to open in the existing browser rather than as a new Pop-up window<br>\
This may cause problems later - please try enabling JavaScript or contact your Blackboard Administrator for advice<br><br>\
You will need to use the <b>Back</b> button on your browser to return to the previous page as the <i>Close this Pop-up</i> buttons also rely on JavaScript to function!
testPopUp.CloseButtonTitle=Close this Window
testPopUp.CloseButtonAlt=Close
testPopUp.pageInstructions=This page is used to see if your browser is set to allow pages to be displayed in a new Pop-up window

# ---------------------------------
# module/moreInfo.jsp
moreInfo.pageInstructions=This page explains more about the tests used. Each entry contains a link providing further information about the products, download pages, etc.

moreInfo.Local.Help=Local Help
moreInfo.Local.Help.Website=For more information look at 
moreInfo.Local.Help.Contact=or contact 

moreInfo.Remainder=The remainder of this page provides some brief explanations of the checks made by your browser.<br>\
Note that you if you are using a computer in a public computer lab, you may not have the necessary administrator rights to install or configure software. \
If you are using your own computer, you should be able to make the changes as long as your account has administrator rights.<br> \
If you have any questions you are advised to consult your local IT staff or follow the links at the end of each entry for more information.

moreInfo.Wikipedia=Many of the explanations are based on entries in 

moreInfo.JavaScript=JavaScript
moreInfo.JavaScript.text=This is a script-based programming language which can perform actions by running code inside your web browser (client-side). \
Confusingly, despite the name, it has nothing to do with the Java programming language. \
One major use of JavaScript is to write functions to perform tasks such as opening a new window, checking input values on a form before it is submitted, changing images as the mouse cursor moves over, etc. \
These tasks are not possible in simple static HTML pages.<br> \
Many of the user interface features in Blackboard such as form checking and messaging functions depend upon the browser being able to run JavaScript. 

moreInfo.Cookies=Cookies
moreInfo.Cookies.text=A 'cookie' is small text file sent by a web server (such as the one running Blackboard) to your web browser. \
It is subsequently returned by the browser each time it accesses that server. \
Cookies are used for data exchange, they can record information about your interaction with the web server and between one page and another (e.g. remembering the user, storing your progress through a test, or saving information such as the last page visited). \
In technical terms, cookies maintain state between otherwise stateless HTTP transactions.<br>\
For Blackboard to work (even to let you log in), it needs your browser to accept cookies.

moreInfo.Java=Java Runtime Environment
moreInfo.Java.text=Parts of Blackboard such as the Virtual Classroom are actually separate applications written in the Java programming language. \
To run these programs you need to have certain files installed on your computer - which allow it to run the Java code (and so create the virtual classroom interface).<br>\
For best results you should install the <b>same</b> version of Java that is running on this Blackboard server.<br> \
This server is currently running Java Version <b>  
moreInfo.Java.text2=</b>. If you are in doubt which version of Java you need, please contact 
moreInfo.Java.text3=<br>If you use the <b>Oracle Java Test</b> button on the previous page to test which version of Java you have installed a test page written by Sun (the authors of Java) is displayed. \
There is likely to be a small pause after the page first appears whilst a Java Applet (a small program which runs in your browser) is downloaded and runs. \
If you have Java installed it should display details of the version as shown below:<br><br>\
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;" src='../images/bt-jreTest.png' title='Results of the JRE test' width='500' height='257'><br><br>\
<br><b>Note:</b>Java versions were originally numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. but more recently the '1.' prefix is often dropped and versions 1.5 and 1.6 are usually just referred to as version 5 and 6. \
In the example above, the test shows that the user is running a Java version 6, update 10, this is the same as Java Version 1.6.10.<br> \
As discussed above, don't be too quick to update to the very latest version of Java unless you are having problems.

moreInfo.Flash=Macromedia Flash Player
moreInfo.Flash.text=Often just referred to as the 'Flash Player' this is a multimedia and application player originally created by Macromedia and now distributed by Adobe. \
It plays SWF files which can be created with the Macromedia Flash authoring tool, or a number of other Macromedia and third party tools.<br>\
Flash is a common format for third party content, particularly those involving complex animations or embedded video (such as those on You Tube). You will need the player installed on your computer to see SWF files.

moreInfo.Shock=Macromedia Shockwave
moreInfo.Shock.text=Shockwave was Macromedia's first multimedia player and is often confused with its more widely adopted successor - Flash. \
Although installed on fewer browsers, Shockwave is much better at displaying information in '3D' and so is very popular with a online game publishers. \
Flash files can be played using a Shockwave player, but not vice versa.<br>\
Shockwave is a common format for third party content. You will need the player installed on your computer to use Shockwave files.

moreInfo.WMP=Windows Media Player
moreInfo.WMP.text=Windows Media Player is a free software media player used for playing audio and video on personal computers running Microsoft Windows. \
Versions are also available for other operating systems. \
The basic file formats are WMV (Windows Media Video & Audio), WMA (Windows Media Audio), and ASF (Audio Structured File).<br>\
If you need to play any third party content in one of these formats, you will need this player (or another able to play the files) installed on your computer.

moreInfo.Real=RealPlayer
moreInfo.Real.text=RealPlayer is a media player created by RealNetworks, that plays a number of multimedia formats including multiple generations of RealAudio and RealVideo codecs as well as many others. \
Two versions of the software exist, a free player and a fully featured player which needs to be purchased. The free version is sufficient for playing files.<br>\
If any third party content has been added in Real format, you may need this player (or another able to play the files) installed on your computer.

moreInfo.QT=Apple QuickTime
moreInfo.QT.text=QuickTime is a multimedia technology developed by Apple Computer, capable of handling various formats of digital video, sound, text, animation, music, and immersive virtual reality panoramic images.<br>\
If any third party content has been added in the formats listed above, you may need this player (or another able to play the files) installed on your computer.

moreInfo.SVG=SVG Viewer
moreInfo.SVG.text=Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) use an XML markup language designed for describing two-dimensional static or animated vector graphics (i.e. those created from discrete shapes, rather than the pixels used in bitmaps such as digital photos). As such the underlying file is created in text. \
SVG-type graphics are far less common than other web formats, e.g. GIF, JPEG and PNG. \
As such many older web browsers cannot display them without installing additional software.
unused.extra.button.do.not.translate=<br>\
You can see if your browser is able to display SVG images by clicking on this button:<br>\
<a href="javascript:checkBigPopUp('svgTest.jsp');" title="Click to try displaying an SVG file" id="svgTest"  class="genericButton">SVG Image Test</a>


moreInfo.Acrobat=Acrobat Reader
moreInfo.Acrobat.text=The Acrobat Reader program (now just called Adobe Reader) allows the viewing and printing of Portable Document Format (PDF) files. \
It is available as a free download from Adobe's web site. \
Other programs which also support the creation of PDF files (such as Adobe Acrobat) are also available for purchase, but these are not required simply to view a PDF file. \
It was developed by Adobe Systems as a way of representing documents in a manner that is independent of the original software, hardware, and operating system used to create them. \
A PDF file can describe documents containing any combination of text, graphics and images in a device independent and resolution independent format. \
These documents can be one page or thousands of pages, very simple or extremely complex with a rich use of fonts, graphics, colour, and images.

moreInfo.PopUp.text=This section provides examples of successful outputs from the alert and Pop-up tests. Some features of Blackboard may not work if you fail these tests

#Pass alert test graphic
moreInfo.PassAlert.Alt=Alert message
moreInfo.PassAlert.Title=If you see this box then your browser allows alerts
moreInfo.PassAlert.Text=If your web browser currently permits JavaScript alert messages, then when you click on the <b>Display an Alert</b> button you should see a box like the one shown bellow. \
If not, you should check whether your browser supports JavaScript - seek advice from your IT department.
# Pass popup
moreInfo.PassPopUp.Alt=Pop-up message
moreInfo.PassPopUp.Title=If you see this window then your browser allows Pop-ups
moreInfo.PassPopUp.Text=If your web browser currently permits JavaScript Pop-up windows, then when you click on the <b>Display a Pop-up</b> button it should open a new browser window. \
If not, you should first check whether the browser supports JavaScript and then whether it has any Pop-up blocking software. You will need to configure these to allow Pop-ups coming from your Blackboard server. \
If the page is displayed, but in the same window rather than as a new Pop-up, then this can also indicate a problem stemming from a software Pop-up blocker or JavaScript being disabled in your Browser. \
If you do not know how to enable Pop-ups from this server, seek advice from your IT department.

# module/svgTest.jsp
svgTest.title= SVG Test
svgTest.pageInstructions=This page attempts to display an SVG file included on the page<br>\
For reasons best known to Microsoft, if you don't have a plug-in install this page will fail to load completely<br>\
If this happens just close this window
svgTest.text=Two images are shown below, the left hand one is a standard bitmap (PNG) image, the right hand image is a vector SVG file. \
If they both look very similar (the text may be a slightly different size or font) then you have a SVG viewer installed.</p>\
<p><img src='../images/svg.png' title='bitmap (PNG) version' width='160' height='120'>&nbsp;<object data='../images/svg.svg' width='160' height='120' type='image/svg+xml'/></p>\
<p>If any third party content has been added in this format and you can't see both images then you will need to install a plugin.

#module/offCampus.jsp
offCampus.pageInstructions=This page provides a brief description of common problems faced by off-campus users

# More Information
offCampus.LocalInfo=Local Information
offCampus.MoreInfo=For more information look at
offCampus.or.contact=or contact


offCampus.from.home=Accessing Blackboard from Home
offCampus.from.home.text=If you are not connecting to Blackboard directly using our network, you might need to consider the following options:

# Proxy Server
offCampus.Proxy=Proxy Server
offCampus.Proxy.text=A proxy server is an intermediate system through which all your internet traffic is routed. \
Proxies can provide a fast service and allow filtering of servers to block unsuitable content. \
If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) uses a proxy server, when you try to connect directly to Blackboard you are actually connecting to their proxy server. \
The proxy server then provides the resource, possibly by connecting to the Blackboard server, or by serving a stored version (from a cache). \
In some cases, the proxy may alter the client's request or the server's response for various purposes.<br> \
Accessing Blackboard via an intermediate proxy server can lead to timeout problems, or errors when completing multi-stage procedures such as online tests. \
If at all possible, you want to prevent the browser routing requests through the proxy when connecting to Blackboard.<br>\
You might need to consult your ISP for more advice.

# Anti-Virus Software
offCampus.Virus=Anti-Virus Software
offCampus.Virus.text=Anti-virus software consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software (malware). \
You should ensure you have anti-virus software installed on your computer and regularly update it. \
Correctly configured, good anti-virus software should not interfere with Blackboard.<br>\
Check the settings of features such as Pop-up blockers which can conflict with the JavaScript functions in Blackboard.

# FireWall
offCampus.FireWall=FireWall
offCampus.Firewall.text=In computing, a firewall is a piece of hardware and/or software which functions in a networked environment to prevent unwanted/unauthorised communications. \
These are defined by the security policy on your computer and the networks you are using. \
A firewall has the basic task of controlling traffic between different zones of trust. \
Typical zones of trust include the Internet (a zone with no trust) and an internal network (a zone with high trust). \
The ultimate goal is to provide controlled connectivity between zones of differing trust levels through the enforcement of a security policy and connectivity model based on the least privilege principle. \
If you are running a personal firewall on your computer you may need to configure it to allow your web browser to communicate with Blackboard over certain communication ports. \
Proper configuration of firewalls is a skilled task and may require assistance from your ISP or local IT staff.

adminHelp.module.intro=This tool has been designed to help users diagnose problems they encounter when trying to use Blackboard. \
The tool creates a portal module which you can add to a tab. \
It is shown here outlined in red:<br><br> \
<img src='../images/module_on_tab.png' title='The Browser Test portal module deployed on the My Institution Tab'><br><br>\
Users begin the tests by clicking the <b>Test your Browser</b> button

adminHelp.browserTest The test results are displayed on a new page. \
This shows information which may help the user and IT Helpdesk staff diagnose and solve common problems.<br><br> \
<img src='../images/top_of_tests.png' title='Sample (successful) test results'><br><br> \
It uses a series of JavaScript tests to query the user's browser and report on the configuration settings and the availability of common plug-ins.

adminHelp.tests=These are generic rather than version specific - e.g. the JRE test looks to see if the user has <i>any</i> form of Java installed, \
not a particular version deemed most suitable for the current configuration. \
This is by design, to avoid having to continually update the tests as your system is updated.<br>\
The first three tests (support for JavaScipt, Cookies and Java) are flagged as <b>Required Components</b> as without these three many \
aspects of Blackboard will fail to operate properly, if at all.

adminHelp.tests.optional=Below these are a series of tests for <b>Optional Components</b> which look for common plugins, e.g. \
Flash, Quicktime, etc. \
These will search for ActiveX components in Internet Explorer and the user may be asked if they want to alow them to run. \
If a user doesn't allow the test to run, they shouldn't expect to see meaningful results :-)<br>\
The test results are colour-coded to highlight any problems:<br><br>\
<img src='../images/optionalTests.png' title='Sample optional tests, showing a mix of success and failure'>

adminHelp.popups=At the foot of the browser test page are two further sets of tests: \
one to ensure that the user can display Pop-ups and a second with sample files to download - \
standard Microsoft Office and Acrobat files:<br><br>\
<img src='../images/sampleContent.png' title='Test buttons and sample files'><br><br>\
The <b>More Information</b> page shows the user samples of what should happen when a user clicks on the two buttons

adminHelp.actionBar=The actionBar on the browser test page gives a link to a <b>More Information</b> page, \
which provides an explanation of the tests, together with links to Wikipedia providing more information and further links to the relevant download pages.<br>\
There is also an optional <b>Off-Campus Users</b> page which you can choose to display or hide.<br> \
Both these pages contain sections of configurable text that you can use to direct users to appropriate local resources and sources of assistance.

adminHelp.otherTests=There is a final <b>Other Tests</b> button that provides users with the ability to check their browsers support for langauges, \
try playing some Apple Quicktime and Microsoft AVI test files, or submitting text using everyone's favourite - the Visual Text Editor. \
These are designed to help diagnose common user problems.

adminHelp.footer=This tool is fully internationalised, meaning that all the text displayed is drawn from a separate language file.\
If you'd like to provide a translation of the text (no programming knowledge required) , please contact the author (<a href='mailto:malcolm.murray@durham.ac.uk'>malcolm.murray@durham.ac.uk</a>)
